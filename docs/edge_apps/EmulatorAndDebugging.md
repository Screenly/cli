## Edge App emulator

After making the Edge App, you can use the Edge App emulator to test it in your web browser.

* To do this, open your terminal and navigate to the Edge App directory.
* Run this command:

> Run Edge App emulator

```bash
$ screenly edge-app run
```
This will provide you with a URL to access your Edge App in your browser.

If you don't have the sample data in your Edge App directory, you can create it by running this command:

> Add mock data to run Edge App emulator

```bash
$ screenly edge-app run --generate-mock-data
```

After generating the mock data, run the Edge App emulator again to see your app in action.
